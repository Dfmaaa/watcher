#NOTE
you can probably save memory by deleting some fields, dont worry, removing some fields wont break the whole thing, you'll just need to remove some lines(2-3 lines). 
For example, initally the parent field didn't exist, if you dont need it feel free to remove it, same goes for the string container in fnode.
I encourage users to change things.
