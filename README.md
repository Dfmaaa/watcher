#FOR USERS THAT ONLY WANT THE TREE AND NOT THE HELPER CODE
Switch to the no_helpers branch, that branch has been made for users that want just the tree, because they wanna use it for something else. I get where those people are coming
from, because initially even I didn't know what I wanted to do after writing the tree generation code for a while. That tree can be used for anything.
